# TypeScript Serialized Block Editor Demo

This project demonstrates how to implement a standalone WordPress Block Editor with TypeScript support and proper serialization/deserialization of block content. It builds upon the TypeScript integration example while adding robust handling of block data persistence.

## Key Features

- Full TypeScript support for WordPress Gutenberg components
- Proper serialization of block content to/from HTML
- Type-safe block parsing and serialization
- Persistence of block data with type checking
- Integration with WordPress block serializer/parser

## Technical Implementation

The project implements:

- TypeScript configuration optimized for WordPress Block Editor
- Type-safe block serialization/deserialization using @wordpress/blocks
- Proper typing for block content and attributes
- Safe conversion between block objects and HTML
- Persistence layer with type checking

## Why Serialization Matters

Block serialization is crucial for:

1. Saving block content as HTML that can be stored/loaded
2. Converting between block objects and HTML representation
3. Maintaining block integrity when saving/loading content
4. Proper handling of block attributes and inner content
5. Compatibility with WordPress block format

This implementation ensures type safety throughout the serialization process while maintaining compatibility with WordPress block formats.
